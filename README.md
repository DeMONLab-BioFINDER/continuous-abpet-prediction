# continuous-abpet-prediction

Code for analyses in "Prediction of continuous amyloid positron emission tomography with fluid measures of phosphorylated tau and Î²-amyloid" (Mattsson-Carlgren et al. 2025). 

The code consists of three notebooks:

1. Results_3.2 for model development and feature selection in the subset of data with all features available (BF2-Initial).
2. Results_3.3_3.5_3.6_3.7 for predictive regression models based on the best model maximizing the number of subjects based on the features selected in 1. (e.g, BF2-P-MS).
3. Results_3.4_3.7 for the two-step model of i) classifying Ab-status and 2) predicting the load within the positive and negative range.

The code was originally written by Weizhong Tang (2023-2024) with minor revisions and updates made by Linda Karlsson.
